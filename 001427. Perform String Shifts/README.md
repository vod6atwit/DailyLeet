# [1427. Perform String Shifts](https://leetcode.com/problems/perform-string-shifts/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=premium-algo-100)

You are given a string `s` containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix `shift`, where `shift[i] = [direction<sub>i</sub>, amount<sub>i</sub>]`:

- `direction<sub>i</sub>` can be `0` (for left shift) or `1` (for right shift).
- `amount<sub>i</sub>` is the amount by which string `s` is to be shifted.
- A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of `s` and append it to the end.
- Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of `s` and add it to the beginning.

Return the final string after all operations.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "abc", shift = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: "cab"
Explanation:
[0,1] means shift to left by 1. "abc" -> "bca"
[1,2] means shift to right by 2. "bca" -> "cab"```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "abcdefg", shift = [[1,1],[1,1],[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: "efgabcd"
Explanation: 
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "abcdefg" -> "gabcdef"
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "gabcdef" -> "fgabcde"
[0,2] means shift to left by 2. "fgabcde" -> "abcdefg"
[1,3] means shift to right by 3. "abcdefg" -> "efgabcd"```

**Constraints:** 

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` only contains lower case English letters.
- `1 <= shift.length <= 100`
- `shift[i].length == 2`
- `direction<sub>i</sub>`<sub> </sub>is either `0` or `1`.
- `0 <= amount<sub>i</sub> <= 100`
